***************************************************************


**ABSTRACT:** SounderPy is a simple, open-source Python package for retrieving and plotting 
vertical profile (sounding) data. Built for simplicity and reliability for all uses and users, this 
project’s goal is to provide a uniform method for sounding analysis across multiple data types. 
Severe weather analysis and forecasting requires a sound comprehension of thermodynamic and 
kinematic properties of the environment. SounderPy makes this possible with robust access to 
data and custom visualizations. The tool creates complex yet effective sounding and hodograph 
plots with high readability which are designed specifically for severe weather analysis and 
forecasting. SounderPy is capable of retrieving and plotting model forecast data, observed 
radiosonde data, Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) 
observation data, and model reanalysis data. All of this functionality can be completed in three
simple lines of code or less, making SounderPy an accessible tool for both Python experts and 
novices. A number of scientific Python libraries build the base of SounderPy’s efficient and 
durable functionality, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, xarray, Metpy, and SHARPpy. SounderPy is 
available through GitHub and PyPi and is distributed under an MIT license. 


SounderPy has been used by several institutions. For example, this tool has been implemented by the Des Moines, Columbia, and Grand Rapids National Weather Service Offices, the State University of New York at Albany, Mississippi State University, the University of North Dakota, and others. Many students at various universities have used SounderPy in projects and papers, such as students at Ohio State University, Central Michigan University, Iowa State University, & Rizal Technological University.

☕ SounderPy is an open-source package developed on my own time. If you would you like to support continued SounderPy development, consider "`Buying me a coffee <https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kylejgillett>`_"! ☕

Installation
------------

SounderPy is available on PyPi and can be installed via ``pip``:

	.. code-block:: console

	   pip install sounderpy 

or via ``conda forge`` by first setting up the ``conda-forge`` channel:

	.. code-block:: console

	   conda config --add channels conda-forge
	   conda config --set channel_priority strict

	then you can install sounderpy via:

	.. code-block:: console

		conda install sounderpy 

	or 

	.. code-block:: console

		mamba install sounderpy


In your Python document, its fun to import SounderPy as ``spy``!:

.. code-block:: python

	import sounderpy as spy

Sample Basic Use 
-----------------

SounderPy is designed for simple and efficient use for all users. Below is a basic example plotting an 03/31/2023 12z HRRR forecast profile at forecast hour 8 for BUFKIT site 'KMLI':

.. code-block:: python

   import sounderpy as spy
   clean_data = spy.get_bufkit_data('hrrr', 'kmli', 8, '2023', '03', '31', '12')
   spy.build_sounding(clean_data)

Those three basic lines will make this!:

This tool started out as a way for me to internally house all of my data retrieval functions for plotting soundings. As you can see, it has since blossomed into a full-scale Python package.

SounderPy is published on PyPi and the source code is available on GitHub -- this tool is an open source project. If you have found SounderPy useful in your work, I'd love to hear about it! The coolest part of this project has been hearing how many folks have been using this software. If you'd like to support continued SounderPy development, consider "`Buying me a coffee <https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kylejgillett>`_"! ☕.
