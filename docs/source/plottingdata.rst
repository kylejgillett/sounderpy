Initially, SounderPy was a tool meant for getting and parsing data with not as much focus on plotting said data. However, recent releases have put more emphasis on plotting capabilites. Version 3.0.0+ features a number of significant & exciting upgrades to SounderPy's plotting abilities. 

SounderPy can create general :ref:`sounding<soundings>` and :ref:`hodograph<hodographs>` plots as well as :ref:`composite sounding<compsoundings>` plots! 

The `full` sounding plot that SounderPy creates is a complex figure with unique design geared towards severe convective storm enviroment analysis.

These sounding plots are 'my baby' and I hope you find them useful! :)

.. tip::
   **Do your plots have funky scaling?** This is a common issue for smaller screen sizes. To fix this, use the `save=True` kwarg in your plot function.

.. _soundings:

Building Soundings
----------------------------------

While this function may appear complicated at first glance, there is actually only *one* required argument for this function. The other arguments are simply optional settings for the plot!

.. py:function:: spy.build_sounding(clean_data, color_blind=False, dark_mode=False, storm_motion='right_moving', special_parcels=None, radar='mosaic', radar_time='sounding', map_zoom=2, modify_sfc=None, show_theta=False, hodo_boundary=None, save=False, filename='sounderpy_sounding')


   Return a full sounding plot of SounderPy data, ``plt`` 

   :param clean_data: the dictionary of data to be plotted (see :doc:`gettingdata`)
   :type clean_data: dict, required
   :param color_blind: whether or not to change the dewpoint trace line from green to blue for improved readability for color deficient users/readers.
   :type color_blind: bool, optional, Default is ``False``
   :param dark_mode: ``True`` will invert the color scheme for a 'dark-mode' sounding.
   :type dark_mode: bool, optional, Default is ``False``.
   :param storm_motion: the storm motion used for plotting and calculations. Custom storm motions are accepted as a `list` of `floats` representing direction and speed. Ex: ``[270.0, 25.0]`` where '270.0' is the *direction in degrees* and '25.0' is the *speed in kts*. See the :ref:`storm_motions` section for more details.
   :type storm_motion: str or list of floats, optional, Default is 'right_moving'.
   :param special_parcels: a nested list of special parcels from the ``ecape_parcels`` library. The nested list should be a list of two lists (`[[a, b], [c, d]]`) where the first list should include 'highlight parcels' and second list should include 'background parcels'. For more details, see the :ref:`parcels_logic` section. Another option is 'simple', which removes all advanced parcels making the plot quicker.
   :type special_parcels: nested `list` of two `lists`, optional, Default is None
   :param radar: whether to display mosaic reflectivity, single-site reflectivity, or no radar in the map inset.
   :type radar: str, ``"mosaic"``, ``"single-site"``, or ``None``. Optional. Default is ``mosaic``.
   :param radar_time: radar mosaic data valid time. May be ``"sounding"`` (uses the valid time of the sounding data),``"now"`` (current time/date), or a `datetime` obj **Note: radar mosaic data only goes back 1 month from current date**
   :type radar_time: str or `datetime` obj, optional, Default is ``"sounding"``.
   :param map_zoom: a 'zoom' level for the map inset as an `int`. **Note: Setting ``map_zoom=0`` will hide the map**
   :type map_zoom: int, optional, Default is ``2``.
   :param modify_sfc: a `dict` in the format ``{'T': 25, 'Td': 21, 'ws': 20, 'wd': 270}`` to modify the surface values of the ``clean_data`` dict. See the :ref:`modify_sfc` section for more details.
   :type modify_sfc: None or dict, optional, default is None
   :param show_theta: whether to replace the piecewise CAPE plot with theta & theta-e. Default is ``False``
   :type show_theta: bool, optional
   :param hodo_boundary: plot a "boundary" (straight line) on the hodograph axis. Do so by providing an angle and a color. The angle represents the angle between zero-degrees (north) and the upper-half of the boundary line, to the right. Multiple boundaries can be plotted. Default is ``None``
   :type hodo_boundary: dict of lists -- structured as ``{'angle':[], 'color':[]}``, optional
   :param save: whether to show the plot inline or save to a file.
   :type save: bool, optional, Default is ``False``.
   :param filename: the filename by which a file should be saved to if ``save = True``.
   :type filename: str, optional, Default is `sounderpy_sounding`.
   :return: plt, a SounderPy sounding figure.
   :rtype: plt

.. _compsoundings:

Building Composite Soundings
----------------------------------

Sometimes we want to compare two or more profiles against each other. Perhaps at different locations or times, or we may want to compare different models or model run-times. SounderPy allows you to do this!

To do so, a list of :ref:`'clean_data' dicts<datadescription>` is needed. If you want to customize the look of each profile, you can create equal length lists with alphas, linestyles, linewidths, & colors. See below:

.. py:function:: spy.build_composite(data_list, cmap='viridis', colors_to_use='none', shade_between=False, alphas_to_use='none', ls_to_use='none', lw_to_use='none', dark_mode=False, save=False, filename='sounderpy_sounding')


   Return a composite sounding plot of multiple profiles, ``plt`` 

   :param data_list: a list of ``clean_data`` dictionaries for each profile to be plotted
   :type data_list: list of dicts, required
   :param shade_between: Lightly shade between the dewpoint & temperature trace. In many cases, this improves readability.
   :type shade_between: bool, optional, Default is ``True``.
   :param cmap: a linear colormap, may be any custom or matplotlib cmap. If ``colors_to_use`` kwarg is provided, ``colors_to_use`` will be used instead.
   :type cmap: `matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap` or `str` representing the name of a matplotlib cmap, optional, Default is 'viridis'.
   :param colors_to_use: A list of custom matplotlib color name stings. List length must match the number of profiles listed in ``data_list``.
   :type colors_to_use: list of strings, optional, Default is 'none'.
   :param alphas_to_use: A list of custom alphas (0.0-1.0). List length must match the number of profiles listed in ``data_list``.
   :type alphas_to_use: list of floats, optional, Default is 'none' (sets alpha to 1)
   :param ls_to_use: A list of custom matplotlib linestyles. List length must match the number of profiles listed in ``data_list``.
   :type ls_to_use: list of stings, optional, Default is 'none' (sets linestyle to '-')
   :param lw_to_use: A list of custom linewidths. List length must match the number of profiles listed in ``data_list``.
   :type lw_to_use: list of floats, optional, Default is 'none' (sets linewidth to 3).
   :param dark_mode: ``True`` will invert the color scheme for a 'dark-mode' sounding.
   :type dark_mode: bool, optional, Default is ``False``.
   :param save: whether to show the plot inline or save to a file.
   :type save: bool, optional, Default is ``False``
   :param filename: the filename by which a file should be saved to if ``save = True``.
   :type filename: str, optional, Default is `sounderpy_sounding`.
   :return: plt, a SounderPy composite sounding figure
   :rtype: plt


Examples
^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   import sounderpy as spy
     
   # get data | Note: any sounderpy data will work!
   # this example looks at 3 profiles from OAX on Pilger-day.
   clean_data1 = spy.get_obs_data('oax', '2014', '06', '16', '12')
   clean_data2 = spy.get_obs_data('oax', '2014', '06', '16', '18')
   clean_data3 = spy.get_obs_data('oax', '2014', '06', '17', '00')
     
   # add each dict of data to a list
   data_list = [clean_data1, clean_data2, clean_data3]

   # build the composite! 
   spy.build_composite(data_list)

.. _vadhodographs:

Building VAD Hodographs
----------------------------------

*Experimental function, but available for use. Errors are possible.*

SounderPy now offers the ability to plot NEXRAD radar VAD data on a hodograph using the ``spy.build_vad_hodograph()`` function:

.. py:function:: spy.build_vad_hodograph(vad_data, dark_mode=False, storm_motion='right_moving', sr_hodo=False, save=False, filename='sounderpy_sounding')

   Return a full hodograph plot of SounderPy VAD data, ``plt`` 

   :param vad_data: the dictionary of VAD data to be plotted
   :type vad_data: dict, required
   :param dark_mode: ``True`` will invert the color scheme for a 'dark-mode' sounding.
   :type dark_mode: bool, optional,  Default is ``False``.
   :param storm_motion: the storm motion used for plotting and calculations. Custom storm motions are accepted as a `list` of `floats` representing direction and speed. Ex: ``[270.0, 25.0]`` where '270.0' is the *direction in degrees* and '25.0' is the *speed in kts*. See the :ref:`storm_motions` section for more details.
   :type storm_motion: str or list of floats, optional, Default is 'right_moving'.
   :param sr_hodo: transform the hodograph from ground relative to storm relative 
   :type sr_hodo: bool, optional, default is ``False``
   :param save: whether to show the plot inline or save to a file.

   :param filename: the filename by which a file should be saved to if ``save = True``.
   :type filename: str, optional, Default is `sounderpy_sounding`.
   :return: plt, a SounderPy sounding built with Matplotlib, MetPy, SharpPy, & SounderPy.
   :rtype: plt

.. _modify_sfc:

Surface Modification Logic
---------------------------

Users may override the zeroth (surface) value of the `clean_data` dict, when creating a plot or returning sounding parameters, using the ``modify_sfc`` kwarg. This argument is a python dictionary.

SounderPy takes the users requested surface modifications and preforms an "Barnes style" interpolation of the new surface values with the existing profile up several points. Please note that as of release v3.0.5, this is to be considered a "beta" version of the feature. As such, it may not always perform as expected.

The ``modify_sfc`` dict
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   - ``T``: Temperature, degrees Celsius
   - ``Td``: Dewpoint, degrees Celsius
   - ``ws``: Wind speed, knots
   - ``wd``: Wind direction, meteorological degrees (north=0)

   Examples:

   .. code-block:: python

      spy.build_sounding(clean_data, modify_sfc={'T':21, 'Td':19, 'ws': 30, 'wd':270})

      spy.build_sounding(clean_data, modify_sfc={'T':21, 'Td':19})

      spy.build_sounding(clean_data, modify_sfc={'ws': 30, 'wd':270})



**************************************************








.. _storm_motions:

Storm Motion Logic
-------------------

Users can define custom storm motions or choose from a number of 'storm motion keys' to change the storm motion considered by kinematic and thermodynamic parameters during calculations and plotting. All parameters that consider storm motion will be affected by the ``storm_motion`` kwarg. 

Storm Motion Keys 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   - ``right_moving``: Bunkers Right Moving supercell (default)
   - ``left_moving``: Bunkers Left Moving supercell
   - ``mean_wind``: 0-6km mean wind.

   Example: 

   .. code-block:: python 

      storm_motion='left_moving'

Custom Storm Motions 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Custom storm motions must be given in a `list` including direction in degrees and speed in knots. Note: degrees must be in the meteorological convention of 'from', i.e. 'northeast' would be 225 degrees, not 45 degrees.

   Example: 

   .. code-block:: python 

      # 250 degrees at 45 knots
      storm_motion=[250, 45]




**************************************************




.. _parcels_logic:

Parcel Logic
------------

New to v3.0.2+, the 'parcel-update', is a complex scheme for computing and plotting advanced parcels using various adiabatic ascent schemes and entrainment schemes. This toolkit comes from `Amelia Urquhart's <https://github.com/a-urq/ecape-parcel-py>`_ ``ecape-parcels`` Python package, which is based on work by `Peters et. al. 2022 <https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/79/3/JAS-D-21-0118.1.xml>`_. 

When plotting soundings, users can choose from a number of parcel types to compute and plot, such as...

   - Pseudoadiabatic non-entraining ascent CAPE
   - Pseudoadiabatic entraining ascent CAPE
   - Irreversible Adiabatic non-entraining ascent CAPE
   - Irreversible Adiabatic entraining ascent CAPE


Each of these parcel types can be computed and plotted from a/the...

   - Surface-based parcel
   - Most-Unstable parcel
   - Mixed Layer parcel


How to use this feature 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When plotting a `full` sounding using the ``build_sounding()`` function, use the kwarg `special_parcels` to choose which parcels you'd like to plot. This kwarg is a nested `list` (``[[a, b], [c, d]]``), where the first `list` contains 'highlight' parcels and the second `list` contains 'background' parcels. I.e., 'highlighted' parcels are darker and on top of 'background' parcels, which appear faded and behind the 'highlight' parcels. 

   - Example:

   .. code-block:: python
      
      special_parcels = [["sb_ia_ecape"], ["sb_ps_ecape", "sb_ps_cape"]]


   By default, SounderPy will plot normal MU/ML/SB-CAPE parcels and an mu_ia_ecape parcel. You can override this by setting ``special_parcels`` to 'simple', which only plots the common MU/ML/SB-CAPE parcels. This is greatly reduce the plot-time!


Parcel Keys 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note the struture of the 'parcel key': ``sb_ia_ecape``. This is broken into three components: 'parcel-type', 'ascent-scheme', and 'entrainment-scheme'. You can make any parcel you like using this specific nomenclature: ``parcel-type_ascent-scheme_entrainment-scheme``.

  - PARCEL-TYPES
   - ``sb``: surface-based parcel
   - ``mu``: most-unstable parcel
   - ``ml``: mixed-layer parcel


  - ASCENT-SCHEMES
   - ``ps``: Pseudoadiabatic ascent
   - ``ia``: - Irreversible adiabatic ascent


  - ENTRAINMENT-SCHEMES
   - ``cape``: non-entraining convective available potential energy
   - ``ecape``: entraining convective available potential energy


  - Examples:
   - ``'sb_ia_ecape'``: surface-based irreversible adiabatic entraining CAPE
   - ``'mu_ps_cape'``: most-unstable pseudoadiabatic CAPE
   - ``'ml_ia_cape'``: mixed-layer irreversible adiabatic CAPE
   - ``'sb_ps_ecape'``: surface-based pseudoadiabatic entraining CAPE





**************************************************


.. _radar_logic:
Radar Logic
------------
Knowing the location of a vertical profile relative to nearby meteorological phenomenon is vital in understanding what that vertical profile means for the atmosphere at a given time. To help with this, SounderPy employs the use of mapping & radar data to provide this information to a reader.

Using the Map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The map is simply controlled by the "map_zoom" key-word-argument (kwarg) in the ``build_sounding()`` & ``build_hodograph()`` functions. Setting **``map_zoom=0``** will hide the map completely. Otherwise, ``map_zoom`` must be an `int` describing the size of the map. A larger `int` will reveal more of the map (zooming out).

Using Radar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SounderPy offers two sources of radar data to the user. First is a CONUS reflectivity mosaic, and the other is single-site NEXRAD WSR-88D reflectivity. The CONUS mosaic is default because its fastest and easiest to plot, but data availablity is only up to 30 days before the current date. Single-site radar goes back much further but data availability varies by site and date.

To plot radar on a sounding or hodograph, there are two kwargs to understand:

    - ``radar``
        - ``"mosaic"``: plots the CONUS reflectivity mosaic
        - ``"single"``: plots single-site WSR-88D reflectivity closest to the latitude/longitude coordinates of the sounding.

    - ``radar_time``
        - ``"now"``: plots the most recent radar scan
        - ``"sounding"``: plots the radar scan closest the time of the sounding
        - ``datetime(1999, 5, 4, 0, 27)``: or you may define your own time by providing a datetime obj. This will plot the nearest radar scan to the date/time provided.

**************************************************

About These Plots
-----------------

This plot style has been developed in a way that acts to provide as much information to the user as possible with attributes designed specifically for the analysis of severe convective environments, and supercells/tornadoes in particular. You will also find that this particular plot style does not host many of the common and popular severe weather composite indices â€“ that was intentional. Most, if not all, of the data provided on this plot, are considered, for the lack of a better word, â€˜trueâ€™ observations of the atmosphere though most are still subject to heavy assumptions. 

The data on these plots are considered, by most, to be useful in determining critical characteristics of the atmosphere related to supercellular storm mode and tornadogenesis.
