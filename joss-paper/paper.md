# Summary

SounderPy is an open-source Python package for retrieving, processing, and
visualizing atmospheric sounding data. Designed for simplicity and reliability, SounderPy aims
to provide a uniform and intuitive method for sounding analysis across various data
sources. 

# Statement of need

Meteorological data can originate from many diverse sources and are often stored in varying 
file formats and structured in various ways, posing challenges for consistent and
efficient data processing. This wide range of variability complicates the comprehensive
analysis of atmospheric properties needed in describing the past, current, and future
state of the atmosphere.

Standardizing the analysis of meteorological sounding data ensures that meaningful comparisons 
can be drawn across a variety of datasets. From this, reliable statistics and analogs
can be developed, improving pattern recognition and situational context. For example, 
comparing numerical weather prediction (NWP) output to observations allows 
forecasters to recognize recurring patterns and establish connections between past and 
future events, and allows atmospheric-modelers to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of 
NWP products.

SounderPy addresses these challenges by providing simple, uniform access to multiple data sources,
including National Weather Service radiosonde observations (RAOBs), Aircraft Communications 
Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) data, NWP forecast data, and several reanalysis 
datasets. Each of these data types come with unique file formats and data-structures. However, 
after requesting data, SounderPy will process and output the data in a normalized Python 
dictionary, coined a "SounderPy `clean_data` dictionary". Doing so means that every data
source ends up in a uniform format for analysis and visualization.


# High-level API overview

Simple, intuitive classes and functions make SounderPy's API easy to understand and
use. The procedure for creating sounding figures requires only a few lines of 
straightforward API calls that first retrieve data from a source, output the `clean_data`
dictionary and plot the data on a figure. While internally this involves sophisticated
data retrieval & processing methods, extensive manipulations & calculations, and
intricate plotting routines, this process can be completed by the user in just two lines
of code for most integrated data sources. The simplicity of these "tools" in SounderPy's 
"toolbox" allows quick and easy use for forecasters, researchers, students, and hobbyists
alike. After importing the library, just two lines of code will create Figure 1. On top 
of the many integrated data sources, SounderPy also allows users to utilize their own
custom data sources. So long as a user's custom data can be manually sorted into a 
`clean_data` dictionary, it can be used with SounderPy's analysis and plotting functionality.
